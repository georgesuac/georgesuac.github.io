I originally created this website to share my passion for photography, as a place to show my photos from around the world.
However, as I began setting up the site, I realized its potential to serve as a platform not only for my photography but also for sharing my experiences as a marine biologist and featuring some of my ongoing projects and thoughts. So, now my goal is to create a hub where I can consolidate all my work and interests, making it accessible to others who share similar interests, (and particularly mexican biologists). Through my website, I aim to inspire fellow and aspiring biologists, foster collaboration within the community, and provide valuable resources for those interested in marine science and conservation. Ultimately, I hope to increase interest in marine science in Mexico and demonstrate the importance of understanding and protecting our oceans and marine life.

Are you a biologist? would you like to become one? Resources coming soon!
