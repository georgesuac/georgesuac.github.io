I originally created this website as a place to showcase my underwater photography.
As I worked on it, I saw the potential to expand its purpose: not just as a space for my photos but also as a platform to share my experiences as a marine biologist, as well as some ongoing projects and ideas. Through this site, I hope to inspire current and future biologists, foster collaboration, and provide useful resources for those engaged in marine science and conservation. My broader goal is to promote a deeper interest in marine science and highlight the importance of understanding and protecting our oceans and marine life.

Are you a biologist? would you like to become one? Resources coming soon!
