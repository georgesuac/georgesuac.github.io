My research involves marine invertebrates, plankton ecology, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem modeling.
I'm currently developing a lower-trophic ecosystem model to understand how nutrient runoff affects planktonic foodwebs in coral reef areas. My Ph.D. project focuses on the Yaeyama Islands and Sekisei Lagoon, home of the largest coral reef area in Japan.

When not in the lab, I enjoy visiting remote Islands, diving, and underwater photography. Visit my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/196057071@N05/albums/) account to see my photography adventures!
