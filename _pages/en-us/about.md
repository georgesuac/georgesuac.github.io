My research involves marine invertebrates, plankton ecology, biogeochemical cycles, and ecosystem modeling. I’m currently interested in studying how nutrient enrichment alters phytoplankton dynamics, biogeochemistry, and carbon cycling in coral reef ecosystems. Using high-throughput imaging flow cytometry, I investigate changes in phytoplankton community composition and quantify their carbon biomass to understand how environmental factors shape planktonic food webs in tropical and subtropical marine environments.

When not in the lab, I enjoy visiting remote Islands, diving, and underwater photography. Visit my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/196057071@N05/albums/) account to see my photography adventures!
